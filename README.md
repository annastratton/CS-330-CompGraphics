# 2D Triangle Rendering using OpenGL and GLFW

This project demonstrates the rendering of a simple 2D triangle using OpenGL and GLFW. I followed a tutorial from [Victor Gordan's OpenGL Tutorials](https://github.com/VictorGordan/opengl-tutorials) to complete this code as part of my Graphic Design class assignment. The main goal of this project is to understand the basics of OpenGL, shader programming, and graphics rendering.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have met the following requirements:
* You have installed a C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, MSVC, etc.)
* You have installed [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) for building the project (optional)
* You have OpenGL installed on your system
* You have installed [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/download.html) and [GLAD](https://glad.dav1d.de/) for windowing and loading OpenGL functions

## Installation and Setup

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd your-repository
```

3. Compile the project using your preferred C++ compiler. If you are using CMake, you can create a `CMakeLists.txt` file to manage the build process.

4. Ensure that the GLFW and GLAD libraries are correctly linked in your build configuration.

5. Run the executable generated after compilation.

## Usage

After compiling and running the executable, a window should appear displaying a 2D triangle. The triangle is rendered using OpenGL, and the window is created using GLFW. The triangle should be colored with a shade of orange, and the background color of the window should be a navy blue.

## Acknowledgements

I would like to thank Victor Gordan for providing the comprehensive OpenGL tutorials, which were instrumental in the completion of this project. His tutorials provided clear and concise explanations, making the learning process much smoother.
